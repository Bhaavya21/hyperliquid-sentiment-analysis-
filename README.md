Analyze how market sentiment (Fear/Greed) relates to trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid. Our goal is to uncover patterns that could inform smarter trading strategies.
 Bitcoin Market Sentiment vs Trader Performance
This project explores how market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) influences trader performance, using real-world datasets that include both Bitcoin sentiment data and historical trader activity from Hyperliquid.

# Datasets Used
Fear & Greed Index

Columns: date, classification (Extreme Fear → Extreme Greed), value
Represents daily market sentiment toward Bitcoin
Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data

Includes: account, execution price, side (buy/sell), size USD, closed PnL, timestamp, etc.
Represents individual trades executed by traders
# Objective
To explore the relationship between trader behavior/performance and market sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver actionable trading insights.

# Key Steps Performed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Standardized and merged both datasets using date
Encoded sentiment levels (Extreme Fear → 0, ... Extreme Greed → 4)
Filtered and retained relevant trade columns
Feature Engineering

Trade-Level Metrics:
PnL_bin (Profit/Loss)
Side_Binary (Buy = 1, Sell = 0)
Normalized PnL (P&L adjusted by trade size)
Account-Level Daily Aggregates:
Total PnL, Profit Rate, Buy Ratio, Avg Trade Size, etc.
Analysis & Visualization

Used seaborn/matplotlib to analyze patterns across sentiment classes
Created boxplots and summaries to evaluate shifts in performance and behavior
# Summary of Findings
* Performance Metrics Vary with Sentiment
Traders perform significantly better during Greed and Extreme Greed
Fear periods lead to more losses and lower average PnL
* Trade Direction is Sentiment-Driven
Buy-side trades dominate in Greed
Sell/Short trades become more frequent during Fear
* Risk-Taking Behavior Shifts with Sentiment
Larger trade sizes and higher trade volumes observed in Greed
Traders are more conservative during Fear phases
  # Meaningful Insights & Recommendations
* For Traders
Use sentiment as a filter: Avoid overtrading during Fear
Leverage momentum in Greed phases but manage risk
* For Algorithmic Strategy Design
Include sentiment_score as a feature in ML models
Dynamic position sizing or stop-loss logic based on sentiment
* For Analysts / Firms
Monitor performance segmented by sentiment
Identify traders who outperform during fear — potential contrarians or mean-reverters
# Next Steps (Optional Ideas)
Build a Streamlit dashboard for live sentiment-trader analysis
Run clustering to categorize trader personas
Train a model to predict profitable trades using sentiment + trade features
# Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that market sentiment significantly impacts trader performance and behavior. By quantifying this relationship, we can design smarter trading strategies, improve risk management, and enable context-aware decision-making in volatile crypto markets.
